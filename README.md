# StickySoftDev
This will be the destination for all software development code, and some firmware development depending on what Eb wants.
GitHub will automatically save all past versions of code and you must request a pull request before committing changes.
This ensures no code-breaking changes are ever committed to the main branch, and I can go back to previous versions
of the main branch if we ever need to redevelop something.
